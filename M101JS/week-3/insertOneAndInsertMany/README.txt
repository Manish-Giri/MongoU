To use any of the Twitter APIs you will need access tokens. The simplest means of acquiring access tokens is described here:
https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens

The Twitter API client library for Node.js that I used in the lessons is found here:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter

Note that you can place your access tokens in a separate file (.env) and use the following package to load them.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv

The package.json file for this lesson contains the dependencies for the twitter and dotenv packages. See the applications in the handouts for examples of how to use. The documentation for the twitter and nodenv packages provides details on setting up your tokens as environment variables, loading them, and using them to access the twitter API.
